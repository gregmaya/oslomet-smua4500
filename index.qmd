## Content

This course introduces students to the concepts, technologies, governance models, and socio-spatial implications of Smart Cities. It critically examines how digital technologies, data, and urban analytics are applied to address urban challenges such as sustainability, mobility, climate adaptation, inclusion and quality of life. Through a project-based approach, students work in groups to analyse a real or simulated urban case, develop a Smart Cities solution, and reflect on ethical, social and governance dimensions. 
In this course, the student will
gain fundamental theoretical and practical knowledge to understand smart cities, including the relationship to the sustainability debate
applies knowledge and skills to a real-life case study involving local communities in the indicator analysis, development of Smart City planning solutions and policy recommendations for the built environment.
Be able to critically reflect on Smart City concepts and communicate the results of Smart City strategies to stakeholders.
This course utilises acquired knowledge from previous and parallel running courses, such as the advanced methods course, ethics in research, data analysis in GIS, and urban policies, and adds to it the component of smart sustainable cities and the human factor.
