## Smart City's _brain_ {background-image="img/brain.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### _The Back-end_

The heuristics, logic, and models.
:::
::: {.column}
### _The Front-end_

Dashboards, visualizations, and stakeholder apps.
:::
:::

:::{.fragment .r-fit-text}
### GOAL

[To reduce the "Cognitive Load"]()

[without oversimplifying the "Wicked" reality.]()
:::


::: {.notes}
- Remind them of the "Brain" analogy. A brain is useless if it can't move the body.
- Decision Support Tools are the nervous system. They take the data from our models and present it so a Mayor, a Planner, or a Citizen can say "If we do X, then Y happens."
- Crucial point: A good DST doesn't hide complexity; it manages it.

## Dashboard's Anathomy {background-color="#40E4FF"}

::: {.columns }
::: {.column .fragment width=33%}
### [**Indicators**]() 

The "Vital Signs" of the city (Air quality, traffic flow, energy use).
:::
::: {.column .fragment width=33%}
### [**"What-If" Engine**]() 

Moving from static data to interactive simulation.
:::
::: {.column .fragment width=33%}
### [**Contextual Narratives**]() 

Data is meaningless without the "Story" of the place.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- Refer to your Data Viz notes: "Identifying patterns, trends, and outliers."
- In an urban context, a dashboard shouldn't just be a "report card" of the past. It should be a "flight simulator" for the future.
- Example: A dashboard that shows current CO2 levels is a viz; a dashboard that lets you "delete" a parking lot and see the CO2 drop in real-time is a Decision Support Tool.

## The "Misleading" Interface {background-color="#FF8100"}

::: {.columns }
::: {.column .fragment width=33%}
### Aesthetic Trap

Just because a dashboard is "shiny" or 3D doesn't mean it's accurate.
:::
::: {.column .fragment width=33%}
### Truncated Realities

What is *not* being measured? (e.g., social capital, happiness).
:::
::: {.column .fragment width=33%}
### Cognitive Biases

How "Visual Narratives" can accidentally (or intentionally) nudge decisions the wrong way.
:::
::: 

::: {.notes}
- Connect this to your Viz Pitfalls: "Misleading graphs, improper scaling."
- In Smart Cities, there is a risk of "Technological Solutionism." If it's on a high-res screen, people tend to believe it's "The Truth."
- As curators of these tools, the students must ensure the visualization doesn't lie about the model's uncertainty.

## Who is the Pilot?  {background-gradient="linear-gradient(to bottom, #2b2b2b, #000000)"}

::: {.columns }
::: {.column .fragment width=30%}
### High-Level Ops

Real-time management (Emergency response, traffic control).
::: 
::: {.column .fragment width=30%}
### Strategic Planning

10–20 year horizons (Housing, Climate adaptation).
::: 
::: {.column .fragment width=40%}
### Public Participation

Transparency and "Co-design" with citizens.
::: 

::: {.notes}
- Different users need different "Front-ends." 
- A technician needs a "Technical" viz. A citizen needs a "Human-centric" viz.
- Workshop II Preview: We will look at how to tailor your "Wicked Problem" map into a tool that a specific stakeholder can actually use to make a choice.
