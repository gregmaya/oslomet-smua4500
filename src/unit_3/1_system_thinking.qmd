- **Part I: The Landscape of Urban Complexity**
    - The "Brain" of the Smart City & 4 Heuristics
- **Part II: The Logics of Systems**
    - Deep Dive into Feedback Loops
    - **Workshop I:** Mapping Your Wicked Problem
- **Part III: Decision Support Tools**
    - **Workshop II:** Stakeholders and Data

::: {.notes}
- Start by managing expectations: Today we move from theory to logic to practice.
- Part I is the 'Why' (Complexity) and the 'How' (The 4 Heuristics). It sets the conceptual stage.
- Part II is the 'Deep Dive'. We get hands-on with System Dynamics logic to help them deconstruct the specific course assignments they are working on.
- Part III links the "Brain" back to reality: How does this logic serve stakeholders and talk to data?

# The Landscape of Urban Complexity
_Part I_

## The City = Complex Systems
* A city is decomposable into semi-predictable parts.
* It is a dynamic process of **organized complexity**.
* **The Smart City Paradox:** 
    * We have new **technical capabilities** (Big Data, sensors, AI).
    * But they rely on **modelling techniques** devised decades ago to solve social problems.

::: {.notes}
- The city is the ultimate complex system. 
- "Smart" doesn't mean "New." Many of the algorithms we use today were born in the 1960s and 70s to address social housing, transport equity, and urban decay. The technology has caught up to the theory, but the focus remains social.

## Complexity alive
:::{.r-stretch} 
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWM2lc1oRA width="900" height="500" >}}
:::

::: {.notes}
 To a computer or a traditional top-down planner, this looks like total disorder. But it isn't. It is a highly efficient, self-organizing system where thousands of individual decisions create a functional flow. This is the 'organized complexity' Jane Jacobs spoke about—and it is exactly what we struggle to represent in a static model."
:::

## What the Smart City is NOT {background-color="#FF8100"}
* It is **not** a crystal ball for perfect prediction.
* It is **not** a digital twin that *is* the reality.
* **The Map is not the Territory:**
    * Models are simplified representations.
    * In a complex system, "Total Control" is an illusion.
    * We model to *understand* potentiality, not to *dictate* outcomes.

::: {.notes}
- models are fallible. 
- Because of urban complexity (non-linearity and emergence), we can't predict exactly what a city will do.
- "The Answer," they are misrepresenting what a model is. It’s a tool for exploration, not a decree.

## The Science of Cities
:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
> "...cities must now be looked at as constellations of interactions, communications, relations, flows, and networks rather ... than locations [...] **location is, in effect, a synthesis of interactions.**"
>
> — *Michael Batty, 2013*
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/batty_book1.png){height="400px" fig-alt="Michael Batty, The New Science of Cities"}
:::
::::::

::: {.notes}
Use this to transition into the modeling heuristics. If location is just a "synthesis of interactions," then to model a city, we shouldn't just map where things *are* (static), but how things *move and relate* (dynamic). This justifies why we look at things like Networks and Agent-Based models.

## Organized Complexity {background-image="img/San-Marco.png" background-opacity="0.5"}
_Jane Jacobs_

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Cities are not:

- Problems of ~~Simplicity~~
- Problems of ~~Disorganized Complexity~~ (millions of random variables).
:::
::: {.column}
They are problems of [Organized Complexity]():

- A huge number of factors which are interrelated into an **organic whole**.
:::
:::: 


::: {.notes}
Jane Jacobs (1961) borrowed this term from Warren Weaver. 
Explain the difference: 
- Simplicity: A falling stone (gravity).
- Disorganized: A gas (billions of atoms behaving randomly).
- Organized: A city or a living cell. Everything depends on everything else. If you change the park (social), you change the crime rate (social), which changes the property value (economic), which changes the transport needs (technical).
:::

## The Interconnection of Parts {background-image="img/San-Marco.png" background-opacity="0.5"}
> "The city is not a work of art... the city is a process." -- J.Jacobs

* It is a **Bottom-Up** system.
* Small, local interactions $\rightarrow$ Large, global patterns.

::: {.notes}
Highlight that both Jane Jacobs and Christopher Alexander saw the "interconnection of parts" as the central issue. 
For the students' projects: Tell them that when they model a "Smart City" intervention, they aren't just adding a "part" to a machine; they are intervening in a "living process" that will react in unpredictable ways.
:::

## Complexity Science {background-image="img/San-Marco.png" background-opacity="0.5"}
**The Reductionist Shortcut:** 

- A mental habit of breaking the city into isolated "parts" to make it easier to manage.

**The Complexity Reality:** 

- Science not of the "atoms" (buildings, roads, people), but of the **connections** between them.

:::{.fragment .highlight-red}
**Cross-Scale Interactions**

- Single street-level decisions ripples up to the metropolitan scale.
:::

::: {.notes}
 "Reductionism is a form of mental lazy gymnastics. Our brains are hardwired to simplify: we see a 'housing problem' or a 'transport problem' as separate buckets because it’s cognitively cheaper to process."
- But cities don't work in buckets. Complexity science is about the 'glue'—the flows and communications that Michael Batty mentioned. 
- Emphasize that we aren't studying the 'atoms' (the physical objects) but the 'chemistry' (how they react when they touch). This is why the 'Brain' of the city needs to be a systems-thinking brain, not just a spreadsheet of isolated parts.

::: {.notes}
A Boeing 747 is complicated; it's difficult to understand, but it's reliable and linear. A city is complex; it is alive. In a complicated system, if you remove a part, you just have a broken machine. In a complex system, if you remove a part, the system adapts or collapses entirely.
:::

## _The City is not a Tree_ {background-image="img/tree_alexander.png"}
:::{.fragment}
> “It is for this reason - because the mind’s first function is to reduce the ambiguity and overlap in a confusing situation ... it is endowed with a basic intolerance for ambiguity - that structures like the city, which do require overlapping sets within them, are nevertheless persistently conceived as trees.” -- Christooher Alexander

#### Linear Thinking
A $\rightarrow$ B (Cause and Effect)
:::
::::

:::{.fragment .r-fit-text} 
**FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTS**

**NOT JUST PARTS THEMSELVES.**
:::

::: {.notes}
Contrast the two ways of thinking. Linear thinking says: "Traffic is bad, widen the road." Systems thinking asks: "If I widen the road, how does that change land use, and how does that eventually bring more cars back (induced demand)?" 
This is the fundamental shift required for the rest of the lecture.
:::

## Modeling as a Heuristic  {background-color="#40E4FF"}
A model is not "The Truth."

It is a **Heuristic**: a mental shortcut or tool for discovery.

::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
- **_"All models are wrong, but some are useful"_** (George Box).
:::

::: {.notes}
This is a friendly way to lower the "technical" barrier. You aren't asking them to be data scientists today; you are asking them to use models as "thinking tools" to simplify a reality that is too complex to hold in their heads all at once.

# The Logics of Systems

Dashboards, visualizations, and stakeholder apps.

[Logic must precede display.]()
:::


::: {.notes}
Use the "Brain" analogy to ground the lecture. The "Front-end" is what people see (the dashboard), but the "Brain" is the modeling logic we are discussing today. 
If the logic (the model) is flawed, the visualization is just "fancy misinformation." Today is about building the intellectual back-end.

## The Dimensions {background-gradient="linear-gradient(to bottom, #2b2b2b, #FFDC00)"}
_of most urban logic modelling_

<br> 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### SPATIAL

#### RELATIONAL
:::
::: {.column}
#### TEMPORAL

#### SYSTEMIC
:::
::: 


## 1. The Spatial Dimension {background-image="img/dim_space.png"}

* **The Logic of "Where":** Focuses on geometry, distance, and density.
* **Key Question:** How does the physical arrangement of assets (buildings, parks, roads) determine urban performance?
* **Core Concept:** **Social Physics.** Just like gravity, "mass" (high-density jobs or housing) exerts a pull on the surrounding area.

::: {.notes}
Spatial logic is the traditional bread and butter of planning. It’s about the map. It assumes that proximity equals interaction.
:::

## 2. The Relational Dimension {background-image="img/dim_relation.png"}

* **The Logic of "Connection":** Focuses on topology and network hierarchy.
* **Key Question:** How is the city "wired"? Is it about how far you are in meters, or how many turns you are from the main network?
* **Core Concept:** **Graph Theory.** The city as nodes and edges.

## 3. The Temporal Dimension {background-image="img/dim_temp.png"}

* **The Logic of "When":** Focuses on change, evolution, and path dependency.
* **Key Question:** How did the city get here, and how fast is it changing?
* **Core Concept:** **Dynamics.** Recognizing that an urban intervention today might take 10 years to show its true impact (_delays_).

## 4. The Systemic Dimension {background-image="img/dim_systemic.png"}

* **The Logic of "Why":** Focuses on causality and interdependencies.
* **Key Question:** What are the unintended consequences? If we improve transport, does it inadvertently raise rents and displace the people it was meant to help?
* **Core Concept:** **Feedback Loops.** Circular causality where an output of a system becomes an input for the next cycle.

### The Engine
Uses gravity equations to find a state of "[Equilibrium]()" between where people live, where they work, and how they travel.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- LUTI is the "Strategic Planner's" model. 
- It assumes the city seeks a balance. If you reduce travel time to the city center, the 'brain' of this model calculates that property values will rise.
- It is great for long-term infrastructure but often misses "sudden" social shifts.
* **Input/Output:** Zonal data (population/jobs)  Predicted traffic flows and land-use shifts.

#### Pros 
Excellent for long-term strategic planning and infrastructure "stress testing."

#### Cons 
Highly aggregate (treats people as masses) and mostly static (ignores the "chaos" of daily life).
:::
:::

#### Pros
Very high correlation with real-world human movement; requires minimal data (just the map).

:::
::: {.column .fragment}
### The Engine

**Differential Equations.** It simulates how quantities (stocks) change [over time]() based on rates of change (e.g., construction rate).
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
* This is the "Macro" view or the "Policy-maker's" brain.
* It originates from Jay Forrester’s work at MIT in the 1960s.
* Unlike LUTI, it doesn't care where a specific building is; it cares about the *total number* of buildings and how fast they are being built or decaying.
* It’s designed to find "counter-intuitive" results where obvious social policies might fail.
:::

## System Dynamics {background-image="img/sd_background.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}
> *eg. Modeling how a city-wide "Air Quality Zone" affects car ownership and public health over two decades.*

:::::: {.columns}

#### Pros

Powerful for identifying "Policy Resistance" and understanding long-term, non-linear consequences.
:::
::: {.column .fragment}
#### Cons

"Spatially Blind"—it treats the entire city (or zone) as a single bucket, ignoring internal geography.
:::
:::

::: {.callout .fragment title="What it lacks"}
**Spatial Granularity.** It assumes a city is a "well-mixed" vat of variables rather than a physical place with unique neighborhoods.
:::

::: {.notes}

* Mention the "Urban Decay" example from the Forrester paper.
* Explain that SD is about the "Plumbing" of the city. If you pour a policy in one end, where does it leak out?

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/

It rejects the idea of "Equilibrium." Instead, it looks for "Emergence"—how simple individual rules lead to complex, collective patterns.

Famous example: Thomas Schelling showed that even if individuals have a very mild preference for neighbors like themselves, the entire city will eventually become highly segregated. The "Brain" here is decentralized.

## Agent-Based Models {background-image="img/abm.gif" background-opacity="0.5"}

>_eg. Simulating pedestrian evacuation patterns in a high-density transit hub to identify "bottlenecks" that traditional flow models miss.

Captures "Emergent Phenomena" and diversity; allows for the modeling of irrational or "human" behaviors.

#### Cons
Computationally expensive; very difficult to "validate" because small changes in rules can lead to wildly different outcomes.

Predictive Certainty. Because it is stochastic (probabilistic), it gives you a range of "possible futures" rather than a single definitive answer.

::: {.notes}
Emphasize that ABM is the ultimate tool for "Complexity" as Jane Jacobs described it.

It treats the city as a living laboratory.

For their projects: If they are looking at social equity or behavior change (like recycling habits or walking vs. driving), this is the logic they are implicitly using.

# Workshop

Mapping your wicked problem
:::

## The "Wicked" Problem {background-image="img/wicked.png" background-opacity="0.3"}
* Urban challenges are not **puzzles** (with one right answer).
* They are **Wicked Problems**:
    * They are interconnected: solving one creates another.
    * They have no "stopping rule" or perfect solution.
    * They are better or worse, not right or wrong.

::: {.notes}
Refer to Rittel and Webber’s definition 1973. Explain that in a smart city context, we often try to "optimize" things. But a city isn't a machine to be optimized; it's a wicked problem to be managed. 
For their assignments: help them see that their chosen problem (e.g., housing or pollution) is "wicked" because it's tied to a dozen other factors.

#### Key Characteristics of Wicked Problems:
- No definitive formulation: The problem itself is hard to define.
- No "stopping rule": There's no clear point at which you know it's solved.
- Solutions aren't true/false: They are only "good" or "bad," not objectively correct.
- Irreversible consequences: Every attempt to solve it has lasting impacts, making "trials count".
- Interconnectedness: Solving one part often creates or reveals other problems.

## Setting the Boundary
A model is only as good as what you **leave out**.
* **Endogenous:** Factors the system controls.
* **Exogenous:** Factors outside our influence (the "Environment").

> *The Challenge:* 
> If you draw the boundary too small, you miss the "Wicked" side-effects.

::: {.notes}
- This is the most important part of the workshop. 
- Use the "Ecological Footprint" example from your references: London's boundary isn't the M25 motorway; its "resource boundary" is the whole world.
- Tell students: "Decide today what is *inside* your 'Brain' and what is just 'Noise' from the outside."

## System Archetypes {background-color="#ffffff"}

::: {.panel-tabset .nonincremental}
### Balancing & Limits
* **Limits to Growth**: A tech-hub grows fast until housing prices drive out the talent, hitting a plateau.
* **Eroding Goals**: Reducing environmental targets because the current infrastructure "cannot handle" the cost of meeting them.
* **Growth and Underinvestment**: Demand for public transit grows, but the city delays purchasing new trains, leading to a collapse in service quality.


### Unintended Feedback
* **Fixes that Fail**: Widening a road to fix traffic leads to "induced demand," creating more traffic than before.
* **Shifting the Burden**: Using temporary "band-aid" repairs on aging water pipes instead of replacing the fundamental infrastructure.
* **Escalation**: Two neighboring districts compete to offer the lowest taxes to attract firms, eventually bankrupting their own public services.


### Resource & Power Loops
*  **Tragedy of the Commons**: Unregulated groundwater extraction by individual buildings leading to the sinking of the entire city's foundation.
* **Success to the Successful**: High-income neighborhoods receive the best schools, which increases property values and further concentrates educational funding there.
* **Accidental Adversaries**: A transit agency and a housing department both try to optimize their own KPIs, but end up blocking each other's long-term goals.

:::

::: {.notes}
* Learning to recognize "The Classics" of urban failure.
* Remind students that these are **diagnostic tools**.
* They don't describe a specific problem, but a **family of problems**.
* Use these tabs to ask the groups: "Which of these 'Classics' best describes the wicked problem you are mapping today?".

## Workshop: Mapping the Logic {.nonincremental background-color="#FFDC00"}
_Tool: [ncase.me/loopy](https://ncase.me/loopy/)_

::: {.callout title="The Mission"}
Translate your "Wicked Problem" from a vague concept into a functional **Causal Loop Diagram**.
:::

### 1. Set the Frame
* **Define Boundaries:** What is *in* your system? What is exogenous "noise"?
* **Temporal Scale:** Is this a 24-hour traffic cycle or a 20-year gentrification process?
:::

::: {.column}
### 2. Build the Logic
* **Extract Nodes:** Identify the 5–8 core variables (Social & Technical).
* **Connect & Loop:** Draw the arrows. Is the relationship (+) or (-)?
* **Find the Archetype:** Can you spot a "Fix that Fail" or "Limits to Growth"?

::: {.notes}
- Direct the students to Loopy. Remind them it’s a "thinking tool," not a simulation engine.
- Step 1: Boundaries. If they are talking about "Smart Parking," does the system boundary stop at the curb, or does it include the driver's frustration level?
- Step 2: Connection. This is where they identify the "Brain" of their problem. 
- Reiterate the "Not Today" section: Many students get bogged down trying to find "real data." Tell them to focus on the *direction* of the arrows first. If we increase "Surveillance," does "Privacy" go up or down? That is a logic choice, not a data choice.
