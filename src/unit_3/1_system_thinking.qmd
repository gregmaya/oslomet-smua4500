::: {.notes}
- Start by managing expectations: Today we move from theory to logic to practice.
- Part I is the 'Why' (Complexity) and the 'How' (The 4 Heuristics). It sets the conceptual stage.
- Part II is the 'Deep Dive'. We get hands-on with System Dynamics logic to help them deconstruct the specific course assignments they are working on.
- Part III links the "Brain" back to reality: How does this logic serve stakeholders and talk to data?

# Part I: The Landscape of Urban Complexity

## The City as a Complex System {background-iframe="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWM2lc1oRA"}
* A city is not a machine with predictable parts.
* It is a dynamic process of **organized complexity**.
* **The Smart City Paradox:** * We have new **technical capabilities** (Big Data, sensors, AI).
    * But they rely on **modelling techniques** devised decades ago to solve social problems.

::: {.notes}
- The city is the ultimate complex system. 
- "Smart" doesn't mean "New." Many of the algorithms we use today were born in the 1960s and 70s to address social housing, transport equity, and urban decay. The technology has caught up to the theory, but the focus remains social.
:::

## What the Smart City is NOT {background-color=""}
* It is **not** a crystal ball for perfect prediction.
* It is **not** a digital twin that *is* the reality.
* **The Map is not the Territory:**
    * Models are simplified representations.
    * In a complex system, "Total Control" is an illusion.
    * We model to *understand* potentiality, not to *dictate* outcomes.

::: {.notes}
This is your "Warning" slide. Insist on the idea that models are fallible. Because of urban complexity (non-linearity and emergence), we can't predict exactly what a city will do. If a student thinks a model gives "The Answer," they are misrepresenting what a model is. It’s a tool for exploration, not a decree.

## The Science of Cities

> "[...] cities must now be looked at as constellations of interactions, communications, relations, flows, and networks rather ... than locations [...] **location is, in effect, a synthesis of interactions.**"

## The "Wicked" Problem
* Urban challenges are not **puzzles** (with one right answer).
* They are **Wicked Problems**:
    * They are interconnected: solving one creates another.
    * They have no "stopping rule" or perfect solution.
    * They are better or worse, not right or wrong.

::: {.notes}
Refer to Rittel and Webber’s definition. Explain that in a smart city context, we often try to "optimize" things. But a city isn't a machine to be optimized; it's a wicked problem to be managed. 
For their assignments: help them see that their chosen problem (e.g., housing or pollution) is "wicked" because it's tied to a dozen other factors.
:::



## The "Brain" of the Smart City
* **The Back-end (Today):** The heuristics, logic, and models.
* **The Front-end (Next Lecture):** Dashboards, visualizations, and stakeholder apps.
* **The Principle:** Logic must precede display.

::: {.notes}
Use the "Brain" analogy to ground the lecture. The "Front-end" is what people see (the dashboard), but the "Brain" is the modeling logic we are discussing today. 
If the logic (the model) is flawed, the visualization is just "fancy misinformation." Today is about building the intellectual back-end.
:::

## Systems Thinking 101
* **Linear Thinking:** A $\rightarrow$ B (Cause and Effect).
* **Systems Thinking:** Seeing the **Web** of interactions.
* Focus on the **relationships** between parts, not just the parts themselves.

::: {.notes}
Contrast the two ways of thinking. Linear thinking says: "Traffic is bad, widen the road." Systems thinking asks: "If I widen the road, how does that change land use, and how does that eventually bring more cars back (induced demand)?" 
This is the fundamental shift required for the rest of the lecture.
:::



## Modeling as a Heuristic
* A model is not "The Truth."
* It is a **Heuristic**: a mental shortcut or tool for discovery.
* "All models are wrong, but some are useful" (George Box).

::: {.notes}
This is a friendly way to lower the "technical" barrier. You aren't asking them to be data scientists today; you are asking them to use models as "thinking tools" to simplify a reality that is too complex to hold in their heads all at once.
