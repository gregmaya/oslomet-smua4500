Explain that in a smart city context, we often try to “optimize” things. But a city isn’t a machine to be optimized; it’s a wicked problem to be managed. For their assignments: help them see that their chosen problem (e.g., housing or pollution) is “wicked” because it’s tied to a dozen other factors.\nKey Characteristics of Wicked Problems:\n\nNo definitive formulation: The problem itself is hard to define.\nNo “stopping rule”: There’s no clear point at which you know it’s solved.\nSolutions aren’t true/false: They are only “good” or “bad,” not objectively correct.\nIrreversible consequences: Every attempt to solve it has lasting impacts, making “trials count”.\nInterconnectedness: Solving one part often creates or reveals other problems."

    "text": "I’ve spent the last decade at the intersection of data science and the built environment. Early on, I realized that while infrastructure is static, human behavior is dynamic. This led me to the Space Syntax approach—essentially using data-driven, graph-based analysis to understand multi-scale networks. It allowed me to bridge the gap between rigorous academic theory and the practical realities of urban consultancy.\nIn terms of technical scale, my experience is quite broad. I’ve managed everything from high-frequency IoT sensor data for real-time indoor movement to architecting the tracking of entire city bus networks modelling scenarios. I’ve applied these insights to everything from local ‘urban acupuncture’ strategies to large-scale masterplans, always focusing on how we can use data to measure social benefits. My work has taken me across the globe—from Colombia to Australia, London, and now Madrid—which has given me a deep appreciation for the cultural nuances required to work effectivily with multinational teams.\nInevitably, working on European urban development leads you to the Net-Zero agenda. Most recently, in 2024, I led a team of eight researchers at the Norman Foster Institute to develop the Climate Action Plan for Athens. This was a major milestone where we had to harmonize environmental data,set plans for reaching carbon emission targets, and greening strategies into a compliant, actionable policy framework.\nThis work led me to what I call my ‘professional obsession’: the link between environmental quality and human health outcomes. I’ve realized that the environment—whether it’s air quality, climate resilience, or the built landscape—is the primary driver of health inequalities. Over the last year, I’ve been focusing on quantifying these links, moving from spectral analysis of country-wide information to advising on transport initiatives that prioritize health outcomes. I want to move beyond just ‘collecting data’ to reducing the environmental inequalities that impact people’s lives.\nThat brings me here. I see this role at the EEA as the ideal next frontier. It’s the one place where I can combine data at scale, health implications, and European policy. I’ve spent my career ‘forcing’ these elements to meet, and I’m eager to bring that integrated perspective to the Agency’s monitoring and evidence-gathering mission.\n\n\n\nThere are three primary reasons why I am sitting here today, ranging from the Agency’s unique mandate to the urgency of our current environmental timeline.\n\nThe Unique Intersection of Science and Policy First, from an institutional perspective, the EEA is unparalleled. There is truly no other organization in the world where high-level science, legislative policy, and ground-level implementation meet with such a rigorous and independent point of view. For a data professional, the opportunity to work within the Eionet framework—translating raw monitoring data into the evidence base that literally steers the European Green Deal—is the highest possible application of my skillset.\nThe Urgency of the Mission Second, on a personal level, I cannot think of a human challenge more pressing than the climate and biodiversity crisis. We saw in the State of the Environment Report (SOER) that while our frameworks are robust, far too few of our targets are currently on track for 2030. This reality doesn’t discourage me; it focuses me. I want to be part of the ‘course correction,’ using data to identify exactly where we are lagging and how we can accelerate progress toward climate neutrality.\nThe Scale of the Challenge Finally, I am genuinely excited by the sheer scale of the challenge. Moving from urban-scale projects to a pan-European monitoring mandate is a significant leap, but it is one I feel prepared for. I am at a stage in my career where I want to contribute at the highest level possible. I am confident that my experience in harmonizing fragmented data across borders and my focus on health outcomes can provide the Agency with the ‘connective tissue’ needed to turn complex monitoring into actionable policy insights.\n\n\n\n\nI view stress not as an individual burden to be hidden, but as a signal to recalibrate our collective focus. My approach to high-pressure situations—such as a tight reporting deadline for a major EEA indicator—is built on three pillars:\n\nAbove all, I am a team player. When pressure mounts, I believe in absolute transparency with my peers. I don’t ‘hide’ from the stress; I bring it to the table so we can address it together. By fostering a supportive environment early on, I ensure that when a crisis hits, the team feels comfortable speaking up about bottlenecks before they become failures.\n(‘Project First’ Mindset) My first instinct in a stressed scenario is to shift the focus from individual tasks to the overall project objective. I lead the team in a rapid prioritization exercise—identifying ‘must-haves’ versus ‘nice-to-haves’ and playing to each person’s strengths. It’s an ‘all hands on deck’ approach where we reallocate resources dynamically to ensure the core mission is met, even if it means shifting secondary individual goals.\n(Proactive Mentorship and Support Networks) I am a firm believer in keeping close mentors and a professional support network. I don’t wait for a crisis to build these relationships. By maintaining regular contact with mentors, I have a ‘ready-to-go’ sounding board when stress hits. This means I can get high-level advice or a second opinion quickly, without needing a full debrief of the situation, allowing for faster decision-making under pressure.\n\nIn short, I manage stress by converting it into structured team action. This ensures that the quality of our evidence remains high, even when the timeline is short.\n\n\n\nI’ve had a very rewarding journey in my current position, and I am proud of the milestones our team has achieved. However, I have reached a professional ceiling where the nature of the work no longer aligns with where I want to make an impact. I am moving toward this role for three main reasons:\n\nMoving from Advice to Implementation and Tracking In consultancy, you often advise up to a certain point, but because there is sometimes a lack of regulatory follow-through on proposals, it is difficult to ensure those suggestions have a sustained, long-term life. I no longer want to just ‘drop’ a project and move to the next; I want to be part of an institution that has the mandate for the long-term monitoring and tracking of those initiatives. I want to see the evidence loop close.\nSeeking a Long-Term Institutional Vision I am looking for a professional environment with a 10- or 20-year horizon, rather than a 6-month project cycle. The EEA’s mission to provide the evidence base for the European Green Deal offers that stability and vision. I want to dedicate my skills to one cohesive, long-term plan where the data I architect today informs policy assessments a decade from now.\nGiving Back and Team Growth I leave my current role on excellent terms. I’ve learned an immense amount, built lasting professional relationships, and found great fulfillment in up-skilling my colleagues and mentoring junior researchers. However, to continue my own growth as an expert in environmental health and data architecture, I need to be in a place where the scale of the challenge matches the scale of the European mission.\n\nClosing Statement: Essentially, I’m not running away from my current role; I am running toward the responsibility and the long-term accountability that comes with being an Expert at the EEA.\nHere is your consolidated EEA Interview Cheat Sheet.

    "text": "Content\nThis course introduces students to the concepts, technologies, governance models, and socio-spatial implications of Smart Cities. It critically examines how digital technologies, data, and urban analytics are applied to address urban challenges such as sustainability, mobility, climate adaptation, inclusion and quality of life. Through a project-based approach, students work in groups to analyse a real or simulated urban case, develop a Smart Cities solution, and reflect on ethical, social and governance dimensions. In this course, the student will gain fundamental theoretical and practical knowledge to understand smart cities, including the relationship to the sustainability debate applies knowledge and skills to a real-life case study involving local communities in the indicator analysis, development of Smart City planning solutions and policy recommendations for the built environment. Be able to critically reflect on Smart City concepts and communicate the results of Smart City strategies to stakeholders. This course utilises acquired knowledge from previous and parallel running courses, such as the advanced methods course, ethics in research, data analysis in GIS, and urban policies, and adds to it the component of smart sustainable cities and the human factor.\n\n\n\nCourse Coordinator:\nProf. Claudia van der Laag\n\n\n\nLecturers:\n\nProf. Claudia van der Laag\nGreg Maya\nGuests",

In data visualisation, it’s tempting to jump straight to advanced tools or sophisticated designs, but this can lead to confusion and inefficiency if the basics are not well understood. Begin with simple exploratory analyses to understand your data, then progressively refine and enhance your visualisations as your message becomes clearer and your narrative more defined.\n\n\nExploratory data visualisation\nis about discovering insights, identifying patterns, and asking new questions. It is most useful during the initial stages of data analysis when the goal is to understand the data and its structure. At this stage, it’s not about perfection but about exploration and iteration.\n\n\n\nExplanatory data visualisation\non the other hand, is about communicating a specific message or insight clearly to an audience. It involves polishing the visualisation, ensuring accuracy, and crafting a narrative that guides the viewer to the intended conclusion.\n\n\nLearning when to switch from exploration to presentation is key to managing efforts effectively. Investing time in refining and polishing a visualisation is only worthwhile once the message is clear and impactful.",

    "text": "Principles of Data Visualisation\n\nGestalt Principles\nThe Gestalt principles originate from a psychological theory developed by German psychologists in the early 20th century. These principles explain how humans naturally perceive visual elements as organized patterns or wholes, rather than as separate components (see Wagemans 2012). In data visualisation, Gestalt principles help designers arrange information in a way that is easily understood and visually appealing. By leveraging these principles, data visualisations can guide viewers to see relationships, hierarchies, and narratives within the data more intuitively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nProximity\nElements that are close to each other are perceived as a group.\n\n\n\nSimilarity\nItems that share visual characteristics are seen as related.\n\n\n\nContinuity\nThe eye follows lines and curves smoothly without abrupt changes.\n\n\n\nClosure\nIncomplete shapes are perceived as complete wholes.\n\n\n\nConnectedness\nItems connected by lines or other visual cues are seen as related.\n\n\n\nColour\nUtilises hues and shades to convey meaning and hierarchy.\n\n\n\nWhite Space\nStrategic use of empty space to enhance readability and focus.\n\n\n\n\nThese (and many other) principles guide visual perception and interpretation by leveraging the brain’s natural tendencies to group similar elements, follow continuous lines, and fill in gaps to perceive complete shapes. By applying these principles, designers can direct the viewer’s attention, create visual hierarchies, and improve the overall user experience. This strategic arrangement of visual elements not only enhances comprehension but also makes complex data more approachable and meaningful.\n\n\nChoosing the Right Chart\nMatching data types to the most effective visualisation is essential for conveying the intended message clearly and accurately. Different types of data—such as categorical, numerical, and temporal data—require different visualisation approaches to effectively highlight patterns, trends, and relationships.\n\nCategorical data, which represents discrete groups or categories, is best displayed using bar charts, pie charts, or stacked column charts for comparing proportions or frequencies.\nNumerical data, especially when showing distributions or relationships, is effectively visualised through histograms, scatter plots, or line graphs.\nTemporal data, which involves time series or sequences, is well-suited to line charts or area charts to show trends over time.\n\nSelecting the right chart type enhances the narrative and helps the audience interpret the data more intuitively.\nNYTimes Visual Vocabulary is a comprehensive guide for matching data types to appropriate chart styles.\n\n\n\nNYTimes Chart Doctor Poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAim for…\n\n\n\n\nClarity and simplicity: Avoid clutter and focus on the message.\nAccuracy and integrity: Represent data truthfully.\nAesthetics and engagement: Use colors, fonts, and layouts strategically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCommon Pitfalls\n\n\n\n\nMisleading graphs (e.g., truncated axes, improper scaling).\nOvercomplicating with too much information.\nChoosing the wrong type of visualisation for the data.",
