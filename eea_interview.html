<h1>Interview questions</h1>
<section id="tell-me-about-yourself" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tell-me-about-yourself">1. Tell me about yourself</h2>
<p>I’ve spent the last decade at the intersection of data science and the built environment. Early on, I realized that while infrastructure is static, human behavior is dynamic. This led me to the Space Syntax approach—essentially using data-driven, graph-based analysis to understand multi-scale networks. It allowed me to bridge the gap between rigorous academic theory and the practical realities of urban consultancy.</p>
<p>In terms of technical scale, my experience is quite broad. I’ve managed everything from high-frequency IoT sensor data for real-time indoor movement to architecting the tracking of entire city bus networks modelling scenarios. I’ve applied these insights to everything from local ‘urban acupuncture’ strategies to large-scale masterplans, always focusing on how we can use data to measure social benefits. My work has taken me across the globe—from Colombia to Australia, London, and now Madrid—which has given me a deep appreciation for the cultural nuances required to work effectivily with multinational teams.</p>
<p>Inevitably, working on European urban development leads you to the Net-Zero agenda. Most recently, in 2024, I led a team of eight researchers at the Norman Foster Institute to develop the Climate Action Plan for Athens. This was a major milestone where we had to harmonize environmental data,set plans for reaching carbon emission targets, and greening strategies into a compliant, actionable policy framework.</p>
<p>This work led me to what I call my ‘professional obsession’: the link between environmental quality and human health outcomes. I’ve realized that the environment—whether it’s air quality, climate resilience, or the built landscape—is the primary driver of health inequalities. Over the last year, I’ve been focusing on quantifying these links, moving from spectral analysis of country-wide information to advising on transport initiatives that prioritize health outcomes. I want to move beyond just ‘collecting data’ to reducing the environmental inequalities that impact people’s lives.</p>
<p>That brings me here. I see this role at the EEA as the ideal next frontier. It’s the one place where I can combine data at scale, health implications, and European policy. I’ve spent my career ‘forcing’ these elements to meet, and I’m eager to bring that integrated perspective to the Agency’s monitoring and evidence-gathering mission.</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="motivation">2. Motivation</h2>
<p>There are three primary reasons why I am sitting here today, ranging from the Agency’s unique mandate to the urgency of our current environmental timeline.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Unique Intersection of Science and Policy First, from an institutional perspective, the EEA is unparalleled. There is truly no other organization in the world where high-level science, legislative policy, and ground-level implementation meet with such a rigorous and independent point of view. For a data professional, the opportunity to work within the Eionet framework—translating raw monitoring data into the evidence base that literally steers the European Green Deal—is the highest possible application of my skillset.</p></li>
<li><p>The Urgency of the Mission Second, on a personal level, I cannot think of a human challenge more pressing than the climate and biodiversity crisis. We saw in the State of the Environment Report (SOER) that while our frameworks are robust, far too few of our targets are currently on track for 2030. This reality doesn’t discourage me; it focuses me. I want to be part of the ‘course correction,’ using data to identify exactly where we are lagging and how we can accelerate progress toward climate neutrality.</p></li>
<li><p>The Scale of the Challenge Finally, I am genuinely excited by the sheer scale of the challenge. Moving from urban-scale projects to a pan-European monitoring mandate is a significant leap, but it is one I feel prepared for. I am at a stage in my career where I want to contribute at the highest level possible. I am confident that my experience in harmonizing fragmented data across borders and my focus on health outcomes can provide the Agency with the ‘connective tissue’ needed to turn complex monitoring into actionable policy insights.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="how-do-you-deal-with-stress-and-pressure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-you-deal-with-stress-and-pressure">3. How do you deal with stress and pressure?</h2>
<p>I view stress not as an individual burden to be hidden, but as a signal to recalibrate our collective focus. My approach to high-pressure situations—such as a tight reporting deadline for a major EEA indicator—is built on three pillars:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Above all, I am a <strong>team player</strong>. When pressure mounts, I believe in absolute transparency with my peers. I don’t ‘hide’ from the stress; I bring it to the table so we can address it together. By fostering a supportive environment early on, I ensure that when a crisis hits, the team feels comfortable speaking up about bottlenecks before they become failures.</p></li>
<li><p>(‘Project First’ Mindset) My first instinct in a stressed scenario is to shift the focus from individual tasks to the overall project objective. I lead the team in a rapid prioritization exercise—identifying <strong>‘must-haves’</strong> versus <strong>‘nice-to-haves’</strong> and playing to each person’s strengths. It’s an ‘all hands on deck’ approach where we reallocate resources dynamically to ensure the core mission is met, even if it means shifting secondary individual goals.</p></li>
<li><p>(Proactive Mentorship and Support Networks) I am a firm believer in keeping close <strong>mentors</strong> and a professional support network. I don’t wait for a crisis to build these relationships. By maintaining regular contact with mentors, I have a ‘ready-to-go’ sounding board when stress hits. This means I can get high-level advice or a second opinion quickly, without needing a full debrief of the situation, allowing for faster decision-making under pressure.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In short, I manage stress by converting it into structured team action. This ensures that the quality of our evidence remains high, even when the timeline is short.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-are-you-looking-to-leave-your-current-role" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-are-you-looking-to-leave-your-current-role">4. Why are you looking to leave your current role?</h2>
<p>I’ve had a very rewarding journey in my current position, and I am proud of the milestones our team has achieved. However, I have reached a professional ceiling where the nature of the work no longer aligns with where I want to make an impact. I am moving toward this role for three main reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Moving from Advice to Implementation and Tracking In consultancy, you often advise up to a certain point, but because there is sometimes a lack of regulatory follow-through on proposals, it is difficult to ensure those suggestions have a sustained, long-term life. I no longer want to just ‘drop’ a project and move to the next; I want to be part of an institution that has the mandate for the long-term monitoring and tracking of those initiatives. I want to see the evidence loop close.</p></li>
<li><p>Seeking a Long-Term Institutional Vision I am looking for a professional environment with a 10- or 20-year horizon, rather than a 6-month project cycle. The EEA’s mission to provide the evidence base for the European Green Deal offers that stability and vision. I want to dedicate my skills to one cohesive, long-term plan where the data I architect today informs policy assessments a decade from now.</p></li>
<li><p>Giving Back and Team Growth I leave my current role on excellent terms. I’ve learned an immense amount, built lasting professional relationships, and found great fulfillment in up-skilling my colleagues and mentoring junior researchers. However, to continue my own growth as an expert in environmental health and data architecture, I need to be in a place where the scale of the challenge matches the scale of the European mission.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Closing Statement: Essentially, I’m not running away from my current role; I am running toward the responsibility and the long-term accountability that comes with being an Expert at the EEA.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strengths-course-corrected-weaknesses">4. Strengths &amp; Course-Corrected Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength 1: Bilingual Technical Literacy.</strong> (I speak “Coder” and “Policy”).</li>
<li><strong>Strength 2: High-Volume Orchestration.</strong> (Experience with large-scale, country-wide data).</li>
<li><strong>Strength 3: Interdisciplinary Vision.</strong> (Linking transport, environment, and health outcomes).</li>
<li><strong>Weakness 1: Independence over Delegation.</strong> <em>Correction:</em> I’ve adopted <strong>“Time-boxing”</strong>; if I can’t solve it in 2 hours, I reach out to the team for collective efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Weakness 2: Routine Motivation.</strong> <em>Correction:</em> I use <strong>Automation</strong>. Instead of doing mundane tasks manually, I build Python scripts to handle the repetition.</li>
<li><strong>Weakness 3: Communication Density.</strong> <em>Correction:</em> I use <strong>“Top-Down” communication</strong>. Policy impact first, technical details (Neural Networks/Graph Theory) only if requested.</li>
